# Serverless: Solution Architecture

# Content

## What’s serverless?

- Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don’t have to manage servers anymore…
- They just deploy code
- They just deploy…functions !
- Initially..Serverless == FaaS (Function as a Service)
- Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that’s managed: “databases, messaging, storage, etc”
- **Serverless does not mean there are no servers**…it means you just don’t manage / provision / see them
