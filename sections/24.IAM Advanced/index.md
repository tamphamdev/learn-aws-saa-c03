- **Advantages**
    - Multi Account vs One Account Multi VPC
    - Use tagging standards for billing purposes
    - Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
    - Send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account
    - Establish Cross Account Roles for Admin purposes
- **Security: Service Control Policies (SCP)**
    - IAM policies applied to OU or Accounts to restrict Users and Roles
    - They do not apply to the management account (full admin power)
    - Must have an explicit allow (does not allow anything by default - like IAM)
